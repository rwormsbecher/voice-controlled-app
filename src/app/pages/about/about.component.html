    We were coding this out as part of a future tech exploration within Sopra Steria, aiming to see how speech
    recognition AI and AR could work together in real-world scenarios. The idea was to build an interface where spoken
    commands could seamlessly control elements of an AR environment, from moving virtual objects to filling out forms
    hands-free.

    This experiment was also a way to test the limits of current browser-based speech recognition APIs and understand
    how they might be adapted or extended for more advanced applications. Itâ€™s part of our broader push to anticipate
    the next wave of human-machine interaction.
